  Thinking of adding another analysis port in the env file for getting the output signal. 
  Where should I add the code for it. It should be in a fork join with other code as we need all the outputs
  at all times.
  
  Since we are coding the analysis port write during run_phase, will it have any timing issue. Will the write part in the code 
  consume any time whereas pushing the seq to dut would be done in 0 time resulting in miscalculation of outputs at future time.
