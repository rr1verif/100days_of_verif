So lets say we have a valid signal as an output from rtl
And we need to drive ready signal from the TB and capture the payload.
How should we proceed given that we have reusable components for this valid-ready handshake?

Below are the re-usable components -
  1. valid_ready interface
  2. valid_ready agent
  3. valid_ready driver
  4. valid_ready cfg
  5. valid_ready seq
  6. valid_ready seqr
  7. valid_ready monitor

** Later add info on how to re-use coverage component & scoreboard ** 


  -- Thought process 
  So we should consider a top-down approach for making connection. So we will
  see the rtl signals first. The rtl signals need to driven from an interface.
  The virtual interface would be driven from a driver. This driver would be a 
  part of an agent. The agent would have a particular CFG which characterize
  its env. Also the driver needs a seq and seqr. Ready value would be driven 
  from this seq. The agent will have driver, seqr and a monitor. This monitor
  will be re-used to check the validity of the protocol & signals.


  -- Steps
   a.  We need to connect the corresponding valid, payload & ready signal from rtl 
to that
