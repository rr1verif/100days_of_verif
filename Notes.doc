  In tb_top.sv run_test() is called to start the uvm_phase
  At t =0 The first 4 phase get executed 1 after the other.
  Now run_phase starts. And let say the complete simulation takes 10,000ns
  At 10,00ns the remaining 4 phases get executed.
  
  In our tb we may use different calculation across different files but since the use case of uvm phases is to have common synchronization across our env.
  We can also use Phase objection.raised and dropped to wait for a specific code to complete and letting uvm phase to reach next state.
  
  A task is time consuming whereas a function gets executed in 0 time
